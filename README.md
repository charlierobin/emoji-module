# A library of emoji utility functions for use in Xojo projects

A module ( `Emojis` ) of various methods to help deal with strings that may or may not contain emojis, and to help do various things to those string. ( The primary one, letâ€™s face it, probably being to get rid of the damn things. )

Before first use, call `Emojis.initialise()`.

Can be initalised with either an external data file ( anywhere on filesystem or in appâ€™s Resources folder ) or using an internal string constant of data.

Uses the standard data files provided by those good folks at the [Unicode Consortium](https://home.unicode.org):

## Methods:

`containsEmoji( string as Text ) as Boolean` -> does the string contain emojis?

`containsOnlyEmoji( string as Text ) as Boolean` -> does the string contain only emojis and nothing else?

`count( string as Text ) as UInt32` -> how many emojis in the string?

`emojiString( string as Text ) as Text` -> just the emojis extracted from the string

`expand( string as Text ) as Text` -> substitute any emojis with their names

`filterByVersion( string as Text, version as String ) as Text` -> restrict emojis in string to those less than / equal to version number

`findByDescription( searchTerm as String ) as Text` -> emojis with description(s) that match search term
`findByGroup( searchTerm as String ) as Text` -> emojis with group name(s) that match search term
`findBySubGroup( searchTerm as String ) as Text` -> emojis with subgroup name(s) that match search term

`getAllRecords() as JSONItem()` -> returns array of JSON objects, one for each emoji in the database. ( Mainly of use for populating an emoji browser, for instance. Command-N in the app to see an example of this. )

Each JSONItem is an object:

    {
        "codepoints":"1F90C",
        "status":"fully-qualified",
        "emoji":"ðŸ¤Œ",
        "versionString":"13.0",
        "version":130,
        "description":"pinched fingers",
        "group":"People & Body",
        "subGroup":"hand-fingers-partial"
    }

`getRecord( character as String ) as JSONItem` -> get the JSON record (object) for a single emoji

`isSingleEmoji( character as Text ) as Boolean` -> is a single character an emoji?

`isNotSingleEmoji( character as Text ) as Boolean` -> is a single character not an emoji?

`stripEmojis( string as Text ) as Text` -> remove all emojis from a string

(All of this has been developed and tested **only** on *macOS Catalina*, Xojo version 2019r3.1.)

There are some basic tests run when the demo app launches. It all seems to work. But itâ€™s early days yet. Plenty of opportunity for things to go hideously wrong.

[Sample output from the tests](output.md)

(Soft wrapping of the flags, and a few other minor bits, are messed up, but is fine when viewed raw.)

A very basic level of optimisation has been done, I think the thing is good enough for a user interactive desktop app. On the other hand, if you want to clean up millions of strings in one go, I suspect there would be a need for quite a bit more work to get more speed out of the thing.

The module uses the latest data file from the [Unicode Consortium](https://home.unicode.org), which has some new emojis which have not yet been implemented into macOS. ( Like the pinched fingers one in the JSON example above; as of the date of writing, March 2020. ) I donâ€™t think this is a huge issue. But if it was, you would either filter by version, or just get the previous version of the data from the [Unicode Consortium](https://home.unicode.org) and use that instead.

For instance:

https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/12.1/emoji-test.txt
